## How Do We Contribute

The contributors will use a Branch-Pull Request workflow on GitHub to
report issues, suggest changes, and share feedback. Each of the contributors are
required to create their own branch within the group repository, and
then create a pull request to the main branch once their development is complete and tested. 
Another team member from Group 13 should review and accept the pull request.
